Hi, I'm Josh, a software engineer from the UK.

- :mortar_board: Currently learning Blazor, Terraform and many different frontend skills to round off my full-stack skills.
- :speech_balloon: Ask me anything [here](https://github.com/Bigtalljosh/Bigtalljosh/issues)
- :purple_heart: I'm a Senior Dev [@Purplebricks](https://github.com/purplebricks), I do many things from architecture, security, microservices, RESTful apis, all cloud everything and many other buzzwords.
