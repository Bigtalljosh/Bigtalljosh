# OH HELLO THERE!

Oooh Secrets! :godmode:

Testing out the new README profile feature. :boom:

I'm a Senior Dev [@Purplebricks](https://github.com/purplebricks):purple_heart:, I do many things from architecture, security, microservices, RESTful apis, all cloud everything and many other buzzwords. 

In my personal time I'm building a business with some friends using some more nice buzzwords like Blazor, Cosmos and Sweet Chin Music :eyes: 

Currently learning Blazor wasm, many data things, and the latest and greatest in devops to facilitate everything else.
